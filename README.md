# Bildli Gallery

A standalone web gallery that does not use lightboxes

[Demo](https://jereviendrai.github.io/bildli/example.html)

## Usage

This template consists of a stylesheet and a javascript file. The script looks for a div with ID `gallery` and places the gallery content within. The images for your gallery are defined in `images.json` (see example).

## Further information

I created this template out of a personal need, and it's still missing some of the functionality one would expect from an image gallery framework (e.g. it currently doesn't use thumbnails, making it quite heavy on network traffic). I am providing it here in hopes that it might be useful to some. Feel free to open issues for missing features you would like to see.
